# git clone: Used to create a local copy of a remote repository. 
When you clone a repo, Git downloads all its files, history, branches, and commits into a new directory. 
Itâ€™s typically used when you want to start working with a project for the first time.

# git pull: Used to update your existing local repository with the latest changes from the remote one. It fetches new commits and merges them into your current branch. 
This command is useful when collaborating with others to keep your local copy in sync.
